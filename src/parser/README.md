# parser

The parser is implemented using ANTLR. ANTLR is a tool written in Java that translates a grammar to a parser/lexer in a target language (TypeScript in our case). It also provides the runtime library needed by the generated parsers/lexers.

The Go grammar for ANTLR is taken from https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/golang.
